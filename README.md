# Bountiful Blessings of Charlotte County Inc.

Static site for the volunteer-run nonprofit. Public pages highlight announcements, gallery images, and ways to help. The admin panel uses Supabase authentication, table storage for announcements, and bucket storage for carousel images. A private page offers gated access for residents.

## Local development
Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the directory with any static file host. Admin actions require valid Supabase credentials for the configured project.
